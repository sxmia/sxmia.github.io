            Right around the block of 80th street, sat a little old deli called the Mini Market. At the age of seven, when I first moved to Ozone Park, it became a part of my everyday schedule to enter that deli right before school, to get my favorite breakfast sandwich. An Assalamualaikum from a familiar old face never failed to follow. <br>
            The smell of rich, bitter coffee hit our noses when we opened the door. The deli was small and packed with shelves full of mouth watering snacks. It was a cozy little place filled with all the snacks one could ever desire. As for the workers, there was an old man, who stared at the tv screen, stealing glimpses at the door for any possible customers, while his assistant took his time setting up the food prepping section. <br>
            Unlike the Dunkin’ Donuts store just a few blocks ahead, mornings at the deli were not spent standing in long lines. I never had to worry about being late to school. Rather, I spent time talking to the old man behind the counter, who would always find ways to entertain me and my sisters while his assistant made our usual order of egg and cheese sandwiches. It was the best breakfast sandwich I have had. The eggs were so fluffy and savory, with the stringy cheese and the perfectly toasted bun covering them. <br>
            The old man would ask us about our time spent at school the day before, about our favorite books, games and tv shows and so much more. He always left me to wonder how he has so much to say. He would also sometimes show us pictures of his niece and tell stories of his childhood. My time would be spent listening to his stories until my mom would drag us to school, saying, “time waits for no one” and that we were going to be late. Even so, the old man never failed to surprise me as he handed my sisters and me free candy on that very first day and continued to do so everytime we went there. The aura, place, and people I shared my memories with during those years, have become my comfort zone and a place I would always want to come back to. <br>
            Now on that same corner, sits another “Mini Market.” The place I once knew, the place it had been the last time I had seen it in March of 2020, is now buried cautiously in my memories. The place I once knew, almost as well as my own house, is now hiding beneath the newly painted walls, the new counter, the new stove, and the unfamiliar face of the new cashier. <br>
            As I approach the corner of 80th street, I now get a whiff of cigarette and weed, dancing around every passerby. This corner, which was my own personal haven, is now an escape from reality for the junkies. <br>
            As I step foot inside, there is no familiar, old face there to greet me with a warm smile and an Assalamualaikum. There are no more stories being shared. There is no more free candy. There is no more of the assistant or my usual egg and cheese sandwich being made in the back. The only thing that hasn’t changed, just like all other delis, is the endless list of snacks waiting to be eaten. <br>
            Every time I pass that corner, I am reminded of the warmth radiating from years of familiarity, of the many exciting moments spent there, and of the goodbyes I never got to say. I never knew how true my mom’s words were, until now. Time really doesn’t wait for no one.
